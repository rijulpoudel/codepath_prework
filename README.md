#My idea:
I’d like to build an app called "2gether," designed to support couples in long-distance relationships by fostering emotional closeness and shared experiences. The app will feature tools like virtual postcards, a time capsule for saving memories to be opened together, and a daily mood sync to help partners stay in tune with each other’s feelings. Additional features like a shared "Memory Lane" for tracking milestones, personalized soundscapes to create a shared ambiance, and fun virtual date ideas will make it easy for couples to stay connected and create lasting memories, no matter the distance.
